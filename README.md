Walk Your City Raleigh (Android)
============================

**Motivation**:
Now a days people drive to their destinations, most of them unaware of the fact that their destination is just
a few minutes walk. So, the question arises: 'Can we get people to walk more frequently?'. This very thought
guided our client _Matt Tomasulo_ to a new idea and he started with the 'Walk Your City' campaign. 
Physical boards were installed at different places displaying the frequently visited and key locations 
along with the distance from the current point to reach there. This helped people in knowing how close actually 
their destination location is from their current location. Our application aims to give a technological boost to
this idea.


**How does this application work?**:
This is a very simple and intuitive  application focused on guiding users and helping them out with the locations in North Hill- (a shopping mall
 in downtown, Raleigh).  Suppose we have a user, Adam, who had a coffee at the The Coffee Centre now wants to enjoy
 a good movie at the movie theatre. But Adam doesn't know how far the movie theatre is from the The Coffee centre.  
 
 1) So, he opens Walk Your City application and sees a **list of destinations** that are sorted in ascending order of the
 walking time required to reach them from The Coffee Centre.  
 2) Nice, but Adam wants to see how far is the theatre without scrolling much through the list, really fast.
 So, our application serves his purpose; we have the places sorted 
 based on the broad range of **four categories**: 'Amusement', 'Landmarks', 'Commerce' and 'Open Spaces'.  
 So, basically he narrowed down his search to find the movie theatre listed in there, which says 
 **'Its 10 minutes walk from The Coffee place'**.  
 3) Further, he can click on the list item to get **walking directions** on the map and the GPS tracks him as he 
 walks to his destination!  
 4) We have **color-coded** the destinations based on the category they lie, which makes it even
 easier for the user to identify a
specific location. Based on the categories, the users can then decide the destination they would like 
to walk and select it to further see walking directions to that place.    
5) **Scalability** is another important aspect of this application. For this, we provide a web based interface
to the administrator, using which he can add/update/remove locations which are dynamically reflected in 
the application.   

This easy to use application would leverage people of North Hill greatly and reduce the dependency on vehicle to reach nearby places.
